Lauren will control your home for you, attempting to be better than an AI, understanding you as a person.

      <p>LAUREN is a human intelligent smart home. Within her home, LAUREN has deployed a series of smart devices, in order to watch over you remotely 24/7. Lauren will control the home for you, attempting to be better than an AI, by understanding you as a person. You will be able to interact with her by calling her name, but she will also do things for you without your asking. She will learn faster than an algorithm, adapting to your desires and anticipating your needs.</p>

      <p>You can experience this by <a href='https://get-lauren.brownpapertickets.com/'>purchasing tickets</a> for a one night performance. You will arrive at 9pm in the evening and depart at 10am the next morning. You will have LAUREN's apartment to yourself at this time. You may bring one guest with you.</p>
